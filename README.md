## Use of SwiftyJSON
	SwiftJSON is a public framework, aims to deal with the JSON data from Backend. 
	Because of the "Optianal" and "Wrapping" features of Swift language,
	it becomes complex to get the real data and handle the error as the same time.
	It is a must for Fae Frontend Developers to know how it works and how to use.
